* This scripts consist in two parts.
  * **The generator script**.
    The purpose of this script is to get all the groups defined in a mission with a route defined to identify a specific area like 
    * city
    A blue ground Vehicle with the GROUP NAME set as CITY-XXXX will be used.

    * forest
    A blue ground vehicle with the Group Name set as FOREST-XXXX will be used.
    
    * Clear
    This is to mark Clear areas inside forests.
    
    
    
* **The Script to use in missions** (generated by the first script)

    * **tmap.getRandomPointInArea([VEC3],[RADIUS IN METERS])**
    Returns a vec2 position or False if no safe point was found
    
    local randPos = tmap.getRandomPointInArea(pos,2260) 
    
    if randPos ~= nil and randPos ~= false then
    
      trigger.action.markToAll(_lineId, "", { x = randPos.x, y = 0, z = randPos.y})
    
    else    
      
      trigger.action.outText( "Error" , 10 )
    
    end
